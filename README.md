**Class Time**

Friday 4:00pm ‚Äì 6:40pm

**Location**

Unless otherwise noted in advance class will meet @ Outfront: 140 Broadway 40th fl

When meeting at Parsons: 63 Fifth Ave Room 200

### Course Description

Digital interactions are no longer limited to our personal devices but are now increasingly becoming part of the out of home environment. Out of home advertising in the form of billboards and signage found on sidewalks, roads, highways, in transit, and other public places while previously considered a traditional advertising medium has seen significant digital growth in recent years. In this collab students will partner with Outfront Media - the MTA‚Äôs partner for out of home advertising and digital communications. Currently Outfront Media has installed and continues to maintain 590 digital boards across 39 New York City subway stations. This class will be a deep dive into NodeJS, an exploration in data driven design, and an opportunity to challenge what's possible in an emerging media format. This class will partially meet at Outfront Media‚Äôs office at 140 Broadway where students will have access to the Outfront Media team as well as Outfront‚Äôs media lab.

### Learning Outcomes

- Students will get experience working in a space that currently does not have a lot of standards or precedence with lots of room for thought leadership
- Students will have real world experience planning and executing a project with the guidance of an agency / the Outfront Media team
- Students will demonstrate their knowledge of web development, UX, and design in a format outside of the browser
- Students will have an impact on the traditional out of home industry by demonstrating their work and research around technology‚Äôs place in that field to an audience of diverse backgrounds (marketing, the mta, sales, etc..)

### Grading Standards

**`A`** Work of exceptional quality

**`A-`** Work of high quality

**`B+`** Very good work

**`B`** Good work; satisfies course requirements

> _Satisfactory completion of a course is considered to be a grade of B or higher._

**`B-`** Below-average work

**`C+`** Less than adequate work

**`C`** Well below average work

**`C-`** Poor work; lowest possible passing grade

**`F`** Failure

**`GM`** Grade missing for an individual

> _Grades of D are not used in graduate level courses._

**`W`** Withdraw

> _The grade of W may be issued by the Office of the Registrar to a student who officially withdraws from a course within the applicable deadline. There is no academic penalty, but the grade will appear on the student transcript. A grade of W may also be issued by an instructor to a graduate student (except at Parsons and Mannes) who has not completed course requirements nor arranged for an Incomplete._

**`Z`** Late Withdraw

> _The grade of Z is issued by an instructor to a student who has not attended or not completed all required work in a course but did not officially withdraw before the withdrawal deadline. It differs from an ‚ÄúF,‚Äù which would indicate that the student technically completed requirements but that the level of work did not qualify for a passing grade._

**`I`** Incomplete

> _The grade of I, or temporary incomplete, may be granted to a student under unusual and extenuating circumstances, such as when the student‚Äôs academic life is interrupted by a medical or personal emergency. This mark is not given automatically but only upon the student‚Äôs request and at the discretion of the instructor. A Request for Incomplete form must be completed and signed by student and instructor. The time allowed for completion of the work and removal of the ‚ÄúI‚Äù mark will be set by the instructor with the following limitations: Work must be completed no later than one year following the end of the class. Grades of ‚ÄúI‚Äù not revised in the prescribed time will be recorded as a final grade of ‚ÄúN‚Äù by the Registrar‚Äôs Office._

### College, School, Program and Class Policies

A comprehensive overview of policy may be found under [Policies: A to Z](https://www.newschool.edu/about/university-resources/policies/). Students are also encouraged to consult the [Academic Catalog for Parsons](https://www.newschool.edu/provost/academic-catalogs/).

**Canvas**

Use of Canvas may be an important resource for this class. Students should check it for announcements before coming to class each week.

**Electronic Devices**

The use of electronic devices (phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, etc.) is permitted when the device is being used in relation to the course's work. All other uses are prohibited in the classroom and devices should be turned off before class starts.

**Responsibility**

Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent. Late assignments, failure to complete the assignments for class discussion and/or critique, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions, presentations and/or critiques will jeopardize your successful completion of this course.

**Active Participation and Attendance**

Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with assignments, projects, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time.

Parsons‚Äô attendance guidelines were developed to encourage students‚Äô success in all aspects of their academic programs. Full participation is essential to the successful completion of coursework and enhances the quality of the educational experience for all, particularly in courses where group work is integral; thus, Parsons promotes high levels of attendance. Students are expected to attend classes regularly and promptly and in compliance with the standards stated in this course syllabus.

While attendance is just one aspect of active participation, absence from a significant portion of class time may prevent the successful attainment of course objectives. A significant portion of class time is generally defined as the equivalent of three weeks, or 20%, of class time. Lateness or early departure from class may be recorded as one full absence. Students may be asked to withdraw from a course if habitual absenteeism or tardiness has a negative impact on the class environment.

I will assess each student‚Äôs performance against all of the assessment criteria in determining your final grade.

**Academic Honesty and Integrity**

Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.

Students are responsible for understanding the University‚Äôs policy on academic honesty and integrity and must make use of proper citations of sources for writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing their work, taking examinations, and doing research. It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others. The full text of the policy, including adjudication procedures, is found on the university website under [Policies: A to Z](https://www.newschool.edu/about/university-resources/policies/). Resources regarding what plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be found on the [Learning Center‚Äôs website](https://www.newschool.edu/learning-center/resources/).

The New School views ‚Äúacademic honesty and integrity‚Äù as the duty of every member of an academic community to claim authorship for his or her own work and only for that work, and to recognize the contributions of others accurately and completely. This obligation is fundamental to the integrity of intellectual debate, and creative and academic pursuits. Academic honesty and integrity includes accurate use of quotations, as well as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or any aspect of the work of others (including that of faculty members and other students). Academic dishonesty results from infractions of this ‚Äúaccurate use‚Äù. The standards of academic honesty and integrity, and citation of sources, apply to all forms of academic work, including submissions of drafts of final papers or projects. All members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in accord with the standards of academic honesty and integrity. Please see the complete policy in the Parsons Catalog.

**Intellectual Property Rights**

The New School (the "university") seeks to encourage creativity and invention among its faculty members and students. In doing so, the University affirms its traditional commitment to the personal ownership by its faculty members and students of Intellectual Property Rights in works they create. The complete policy governing Intellectual Property Rights may be seen on the university website, on the [Provost‚Äôs page](https://www.newschool.edu/provost/accreditation-policies/).
